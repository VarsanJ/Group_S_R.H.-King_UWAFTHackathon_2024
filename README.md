# UWAFT-Highschool-Hackathon-2024
Varsan J:
Our team of four highly motivated students (Varsan J, Shaurya S, Nabil B, Farhaan K) competed against other teams from all over Ontario at the UWAFT Hackathon. In this hackathon, the core theme was about "Fitness", so we created FitQuest. FitQuest is a mobile application which gamifies fitness by incorporating streaks, leaderboards, XP, and quests. This application has numerous built-in capabilities to enhance a user's experience. Within a few short hours, our development team had numerous tasks to fulfill. I took the lead role in the planning, documentation, and testing processes as a project manager. I created testing procedures, a post test analysis, initial research and proposal idea, and feature analysis involving MATLAB and accessibility. I got used to MATLAB, a industrial tool used for programming and mathematical purposes. Helping with the development and the programming enhanced my skills, such as aiding the development of front-end applications and collaborating with teammates to resolve issues and deficiencies. Our hard work paid off when we won the second place award at the hackathon, beating numerous other teams. This was a great experience alongside my teammates, and I look forward to collaborating and applying my skills in other environments to make innovate and creative ideas into reality.
